# Toll-Payment-Processing
A System which collects toll charge when an vehicle passes through it.
Each toll has its own charging scheme according to the vehicles and whether or not they are a VIP user.  If they are VIP user, 20% discount would apply to them.
Given the details of vehicle type, start  and destination, it will display the total toll paid during the journey and print the amount after applying the discount.
I have desinged a module which  displays the details of vehicle (vehicle number)passed that respective toll and the amount each vehicle paid and the total amount charged in that toll.
Next module of my design displays the details of all the vehicles like what are all the journeys did it take the start and destination of the same tolls it passed during that journey amount paid in that journey and the total amount paid by that vehicle.
